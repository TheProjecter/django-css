django-css was created by David Ziegler <david.ziegler@gmail.com> in 2009
as a fork of django-compress (R98).

django-compress was originally created by Andreas Pelme <andreas@pelme.se> in 2008.

The Python-version of jsmin (http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html) 
is included in django-css. It was translated from to Python by Baruch 
Evan, from the original jsmin implementation by Douglas Crockford.
