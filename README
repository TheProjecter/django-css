django-css provides an easy way to use CSS compilers in Django projects. CSS compilers extend CSS syntax to include more powerful features such as variables and nested blocks. 

CSS files are re-compiled only when they are changed, so you can still serve them as static content.

django-css is a fork of django-compress R98 which automates the compression, combination, and versioning of your CSS and Javascript files.

django-css is available at http://code.google.com/p/django-css/
